# Random-Color-Generator
The "Random Color Generator" is a simple web application that generates random hexadecimal color codes and displays them on the screen.
It allows users to explore a wide range of colors by clicking a button, triggering the generation of a new random color each time.

How the Application Works:
When the page is loaded, the initial call to the randomColor function generates a random color and displays its hexadecimal code on the screen.
When the "Click me" button is clicked, the randomColor function is called again, generating a new random color and updating the displayed color code accordingly.
This process can be repeated as many times as the user desires, allowing them to explore various random colors.

In summary, the "Random Color Generator" project is a fun and interactive web application that generates random colors, 
giving users a visually pleasing and entertaining experience.
It serves as a great tool for designers, artists, or anyone interested in exploring different color combinations for their projects.
